                <p>Sports have been a big part of my life since I was a kid. 
                I have played many different sports, but the ones that I have played the most are soccer, basketball and track.

                   <h2>My Soccer Journey</h2> 
                   <p> I have been playing soccer since I can remember because my dad is a coach.
                    I didn't start playing organized soccer until I was about 10.
                    From that point on, I played for clubs such as GPS, Valeo FC, and NEFC.
                    I have also tried out for teams such as Boston Bolts and New England Revolution, but never fully played for either.
                    </p>
                    <p>I also played highschool soccer for every year except my senior year.</p>
                    <p>My goal tallies for each season are as followed:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Freshman Year: 5 goals + 3 assists</li>
                        <li>Sophomore Year: 12 goals + 12 assists</li>
                        <li>Junior Year: 25 goals + 15 assists</li>
                    </ul>
